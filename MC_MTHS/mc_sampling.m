function [y,c]=mc_sampling(x,L,q,nyqover)
% This script implements the multi-coset sampling of a multiband signal.

% Usage: [y,c]=mc_sampling(x,L,q,nyqover)
% x: discrete input signal that approximates a continuous-time multiband signal
% L: parameter that determines the period of the nonuniform sampling (every 
%    L/W seconds q samples are collected); positive integer > q
% q: q samples collected every L/W seconds (q is also the number of channels)
% nyqover: controls the length of the simulated multiband signal x (conceptually, x is a vector 
%  formed from sampling a continuous-time multiband signal at a rate that is nyqover times more
%  than this Nyquist rate. nyqover is a positive integer.) 
% y: (sub)sampled output of multichannel system
% c: multi-coset sampling pattern
